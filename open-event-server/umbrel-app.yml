  The Open Event Server enables organizers to manage events from concerts to conferences and meet-ups. 
  It offers features for events with several tracks and venues. Event managers can create invitation forms 
  for speakers and build schedules in a drag and drop interface. The event information is stored in a database. 
  The system provides API endpoints to fetch the data, and to modify and update it. Organizers can import and 
  export event data in a standard compressed file format that includes the event data in JSON and binary media 
  files like images and audio.
